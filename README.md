(00:00) chat GPT can help you in so many ways it can help with brainstorming ideation content generation task Automation and much more but one thing it does very well is helping you with data analysis you have the ability to upload over 10,000 rows of data whether that be in an Excel sheet or a Google sheet and you can get it analyzed with chat GPT you can get it cleaned you can get downloadable copies you can re-upload to your program and so much more it's great at helping you view and analyze your data but if you're anything like me you

(00:34) are a very visual person and lucky for you and I we have the ability to generate charts and graphs in order to view our data in a more effective way while using chat GPT so you can get these charts generated along the powerful gp4 model you can ask it questions about the charts you can view your data in many different ways that you never thought possible and so much more I am so excited to get into this video to show you how to generate charts in chat GPT to show you how to view your data in chat GPT and this is going to be

(01:04) wonderful if you want to utilize chat GPT to its maximum potential now before we get into this video I want to show you the best way to learn chat GPT now in my opinion and in the opinion of the members of this group the chat GPT Mastery course in community is the best way to learn it's a private chat GPT community and as you can see right now we have over 500 members eight people are online learning about chat gbt this is the community section and anybody who's in the group has the ability to ask a question upload a video write a

(01:32) description let the group know about their findings with chat gbt when you go to the classroom section you have over 55 plus modules in order to learn chat GPT and as you can see I have nine modules going over just chat GPT charts and this is very highquality content that's going to stay private and not be uploaded on YouTube so if you do like what you see in this video and you want to go deeper into charts and all the features that Chad gbt has to offer I highly highly recommend that chat GPT Mastery course again I'll leave a link

(02:02) in the top pinned comment below and the description if you want to expand on chat GPT and become a master so before we get into generating all the fun charts and the prompts in order to do that first we need to understand the ways to view your data in chat gbt number one comparing data if you want to see how things stack up against each other this one's great number two showing parts of a whole it's important to find out how small sections make up a bigger section we can use things like pie charts or area charts in order to do

(02:32) this number three we might want to view data spreads is our data close together is it spread apart are there any outliers the plot that I'm going to show you in this video does a very good job at finding your data spread number four Trends over time you might want to view Trends over time within your data see how things are going up and down and maybe why they're going up and down as well so those are the four categories I'm going to touch on in this video in order to better view your data now let's

(02:56) get into it as you can see here I have this data set showing working hours by by country from 1870 to 1970 so over an 100-year period it's giving the average annual working hours per worker and this is a 3,000 row set of data over 3,000 so what we have here is quite a bit of hours being worked by these people but what if we want to see how they comp pair up against each other well we can create a column chart in order to do this so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to upload that data set to

(03:24) chat GPT by making sure that I'm in the GPT 4 model and hitting this link icon on the bottom left left hand corner of that prompt bar once I do that I have a data sets folder on my desktop it might take you to your normal desktop but right now it's taking me to my data sets folder what I'm going to do is I'm going to upload the data set that I want to get analyzed so I'm going to upload annual working hours per worker hit open and then the first step before you generate a chart no matter what is

(03:51) always say clean this data and get it ready for analysis this is the first thing you want to do and it's very important because if you don't do this chat gbt will run into a lot of Errors when trying to generate your charts and you just want to clear that up clean the data get it ready for generating those charts also important to keep in mind that you probably don't want to upload sensitive company information to chat GPT unless you get authorization from a higher up in the workplace or authorization from yourself if you are

(04:20) the owner now you can do things like get a team account in order to make it a little more secure and and not have chat gbt be training on your data but just keep that in mind it's important to keep those privacy see concerns in mind especially if you're dealing with sensitive data but anyway we can send off this prompt clean this data and get it ready for analysis and chat GPT will clean that data for you and get it ready so chat GPT has completely went through the data it's checked the first few rows

(04:43) it's checked all my columns and what they may entail and it's went through its four-step process in order to clean the data and it says that no data issues were found and that it's ready for analysis so now we can get ready with the visualizations that we want and this is going to be the first step you take for each of the ways to view data I'm not going to go in depth on doing this for every single one just know that you want to upload your data get it cleaned and then get your chart generated that's

(05:09) a common practice for data analysis you need to get it cleaned before you get it analyzed jet gbt will have a much better analyzation process when having it cleaned first so now I can type out my prompt what I said was create a column chart comparing these five countries and what I did was I used the countries abbreviations that way chat gbt when putting them in the x-axis doesn't cram them together and overlay them a top one another so I said USA Canada Denmark France and deu is Germany country abbreviation and I said I want you to

(05:37) find the total amount of average annual working hours per worker for the 100-year period of 1870 to 1890 that's what the data is going over working hours from 1870 to 1970 per worker and it's giving an annual average and then I said keep the columns the same color and start the yxes at zero when I send this off Chad gbt will give us a great visual column chart in order to see how these count stack up against each other and who had the most annual average working hour per worker over these past 100 years out of

(06:07) these five countries this should be very interesting to see as you can see it gives us an amazing visualization of which countries are leading which countries are behind in the working hours and it's amazing to see how everything Stacks up against each other as you can see Germany has the highest amount of total average annual working hours per worker from 1870 to 1970 based on the data that was presented in the beginning of this section now the next chart that we're going to go over is a pie chart and this is great for showing

(06:35) parts of a whole of your data seeing how smaller parts make up a bigger part so let's get into it so this is the next data set we're going to be using for this we have the top 200 companies in the world with the most money the most market value Revenue profits Etc and this is a decent set of data we have over 200 rows worth of companies that we're going to be showing parts of a whole of but what we're going to be doing is trying to take the top five countries based on the amount of assets that that country owns per company so

(07:05) it's going to get a little bit more advanced but what I'm going to do now is I'm going to head over to chat GPT I'm going to upload my data and get it cleaned so I'm going to select the largest companies in the world open it up and then I'm going to get that cleaned before I analyze it as you can see it's very important to clean it says that it's data types are wrong numeric values are wrong and then it's going to go through some other general cleaning there's a column in there if you

(07:28) remember it says b for billion and it has all the commas this is not the right format for analysis so Chad GPT is going through here and it's cleaning all of that up for me and it's a good thing that I did this cleaning beforehand otherwise it would have had to work through all these issues when trying to generate the chart it might have taken too long and not given us the output that we wanted so before we do the pie chart we can say proceed with cleaning and after chat gbt is done with this cleaning I'm going to give you the

(07:54) prompt in order to generate that awesome pie chart so here we are ready the data has been cleaned and I've typed out an amazing prompt I say create a pie chart of this data that shows countries and how much their respective companies own in total assets make this for the top 10 countries with the most and put the rest in other category then I can say make the slices meaning the parts of that pie chart contrasting in color that way we can tell each one apart very easily and we don't get confused with similar

(08:25) colors and now that the data is cleaned and I have my prompt I'm ready to send it off and get this pie chart generated as you can see it generated the top 10 countries by total assets of companies as you can see everything is a little bit cramped together but that can be fixed with a little bit more prompting abbreviating the countries having the percentage be on the outside of the circle and so on that's a very easy fix but what we have is a beautiful representation of which countries actually own the most United States and

(08:52) China are up there Japan other and United Kingdom falling closely behind uh it's amazing to see this and how quickly it can be done all of this from the cleaning to generating the chart happened in about 45 seconds now the next way we might want to view our data as mentioned earlier in this video is to view a data spread is our data close together is it spread apart are there any outliers well we can find all of that information by using charts that help us see data spreads such as a scatter plot which I'm going to be

(09:22) showing you now Scatter Plots are interesting and I absolutely love them because it gives you so much insight to what your data actually is saying and what it's trying to tell you and it helps you see if there's any outliers and there also might be certain subsets in your data that meet together at a certain point creating a cluster that helps you see okay maybe something is going on here maybe I need to investigate that a little further or I need to put more effort into that section there's a lot of things in a lot

(09:48) of ways you can interpret Scatter Plots but I'm going to show you how to generate that now so this is the data that we're going to be utilizing for the scatter plot as you can see we have rows and rows of data and it goes on and on but what we're going to be comparing from this set of data is the quality of sleep with the physical activity level we're going to be putting all of this in a scatter plot to see if a certain activity level can correlate with a certain quality of sleep you know does

(10:14) your quality of sleep affect your physical activity level vice versa well based on this set of data we're going to upload it into chat GPT and we may come to some conclusions whether they have any correlation together or not so I'm going to upload this set of data by hitting that link icon con and uploading the sleep and lifestyle data and Hing open and once again I'm going to get this cleaned and then I'll type out my prompt and after about 45 seconds it says the data set seems well prepared

(10:40) for analysis and we're ready to go so now I can type out my prompt in order to generate the scatter plot now I don't need anything crazy here all I have to say is one sentence create a scatter plot for the relationship between physical activity level and sleep duration is there any relationship do they correlate well you'll be able to tell by the data and the plot that it generates within chat GPT so I'm going to send that off and things are about to get exciting so chat GPT just finished creating the scatter plot in about 15

(11:08) seconds and I keep stressing how quickly it does it because that's important in order to save time and that's why we come to llms to generate these things is to actually get a timesaver and to quickly analyze our data in a very effective way so as you can see this data is pretty spread out but there is a general uptrend showing that the more sleep you get the higher your activity level usually and the more your activity level is the better sleep you get for duration so there are some outliers as you can see

(11:36) in this data physical activity level to 30 sleep hours at 8.5 to 8 but we also have physical activity level at 90 and people who are getting no sleep so maybe these people work from home in the upper left and don't really get out much or do much physical activity and maybe these people who are physically at a 90 have very long jobs that require a lot of physical labor but again you can change the color of each of these plots in chat GPT to add another variable such as weight class or gender or work type do

(12:09) they work from home is it a hybrid job do they work a manual labor job these are things you can start to add in to get even more in-depth with your data but this is one of the best ways to actually view a data spread within chat gbt is by using a scatter plot highly effective now the next thing you might want to view in chat gbt is Trends over time time and Trends over time are important because it helps you see is something going up is it going down people in the stock market and cryptocurrency especially know this

(12:39) viewing market trends is very important in order to make good decisions but it's the same with anything in your life if you like keeping a lot of data and you track your sleep score using something like an aura ring you track your Fitness using a Fitbit or an Apple Watch you can start to journal these things you can write your mood down you can write your data down how many steps did you walk right what kind of food did you eat how how were you feeling that day did you work out did you not if you start tracking these things for your actual

(13:04) life then you really start to find and pinpoint what works best for you in order to get the most done so that's what makes me excited about data is if I keep track of it in my own life it's fun seeing Trends over time and how certain things may affect the trend and that's what I'm going to show you with this chart this chart's very powerful because it's a very basic column chart but we're overlaying a line graph on it showing how maybe one thing affects another thing and it's very fun this is it's

(13:29) called the Dual access line graph and the Dual access line graph is a very powerful one and we can generate it all in chat gbt so first I'm going to show you the data set that I'm going to be utilizing once again then we're going to clean the data and type out the prompt so the data set we're using for this is very simple we're just using 13 RS this time and it's just very straightforward we have month revenue and social media post maybe this is a sub based platform or just a small company in general and

(13:57) what we have here is the revenue for the month and how many times they posted on social media maybe you're tracking this over a year time span and you want to see do social media posts correlate to more revenue does it matter does it not well when generating the Dual access line graph and chat GPT you can really start to draw those conclusions together so once again what I've done is I've uploaded my data here and now I'm just going to say clean and get this ready for analysis by the way this entire time

(14:22) I've been downloading and exporting everything as a CSV file so the CSV files in my opinion GPT can work a lot better with there were some people in my private chat GPT Mastery course in community that were saying that they were trying to upload Excel sheets but it seems like it would get the data wrong and it wouldn't really do it all that well well I found that using CSV files works very good especially when implementing the cleaning into the process so I highly recommend doing that is if you're using Excel Sheets if
(14:51) you're using Google Sheets or anything like that download it as a CSV and then go through the process it works a little bit better in my opinion but the data's been cleaned and we're ready to go so let me type out this prompt now so I've typed out a little bit longer of a prompt just so I can be specific and get the exact thing that I want generated with chat gbt sometimes these charts and graphs need a little bit of tinkering after and a follow-up prompt in order to get them the way you do like and the way

(15:13) that you can visualize best but what I've said here in this prompt is create a dual AIS graph of this data where revenue is displayed as a column chart and social media posts are displayed as a line graph overlaid on the column chart then I say you can abbreviate the months in the x-axis and then give some examples Jen Feb March Etc make the columns the same color but make the line a contrasting color that way we can see the difference or the correlation a little bit better and we can see these things overlaid on top of one another

(15:42) much easier I'm going to send off this message and then we're going to get that chart generated very very quickly now that the data is cleaned as you can see we got this dual AIS line graph generated perfectly I love the red and the blue on top of one another I think that looks very nice nothing's crammed together because I abbreviated the months down here in the x- axis I highly recommend abbreviations we have our first y AIS for revenue on the left our second Y axis for social media post on the right and as you can see you can

(16:10) take a look to see do social media posts correlate with Revenue growth for this company and to me it looks like it does because the red line is moving with the columns usually when revenue is up social media posts are up but when social media posts are down revenue is also down so maybe this company relies heavily on posting a lot on social media in order to grow their revenue that's that's all I have for this video if you want to go more in depth on this or you want even more charts you can utilize

(16:34) and the best way to implement them and what they all mean have them explain to you and how you can utilize them even better then I highly recommend my private chat gbt Mastery course in community where I go over that and every other feature in chat gbt it's very powerful we're growing we're becoming stronger as a community so I highly recommend that but with that being said I also have a ton of free content here on YouTube you can learn and enjoy from please subscribe to stay updated with the channel drop a like and a comment
(16:58) letting me know what you thought about these charts which ones your favorite which ones do you use in chat GPT and so on all right I'll see you in the next video
